It uses these concepts to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models, and support vector machines. For students and others with a mathematical background, these derivations provide a starting point to machine learning texts.

The book starts from very basic mathematic background knowledge such as 3D rigid body geometry, the pinhole camera projection model, and nonlinear optimization techniques, before introducing readers to traditional computer vision topics like feature matching, optical flow, and bundle adjustment. The book employs a light writing style, instead of the rigorous yet dry approach that is common in academic literature. In addition, it includes a wealth of executable source code with increasing difficulty to help readers understand and use the practical techniques. The book can be used as a textbook for senior undergraduate or graduate students, or as reference material for researchers and engineers in related areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tao"}],"citation-key":"gaoIntroductionVisualSLAM2022","event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"9789811649394","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1272854923","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Introduction to Visual SLAM: from theory to practice","title-short":"Introduction to Visual SLAM","type":"book","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-4939-4"},

In this work, we propose a uniﬁed methodology to design and develop efﬁcient Least-Squares Optimization algorithms, focusing on the structures and patterns of each speciﬁc domain. Furthermore, we present a novel open-source optimization system, that addresses transparently problems with a different structure and designed to be easy to extend. The system is written in modern C++ and can run efﬁciently on embedded systems3. We validated our approach by conducting comparative experiments on several problems using tandard datasets.

  {"id":"grisettiTutorialGraphBasedSLAM2010","abstract":"Being able to build a map of the environment and to simultaneously localize within this map is an essential skill for mobile robots navigating in unknown environments in absence of external referencing systems such as GPS. This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efficient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating SLAM is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by finding the spatial configuration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based SLAM problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the SLAM problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.","author":[{"family":"Grisetti","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Kümmerle","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Stachniss","given":"Cyrill"},{"family":"Burgard","given":"Wolfram"}],"citation-key":"grisettiTutorialGraphBasedSLAM2010","container-title":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Magazine","DOI":"10.1109/MITS.2010.939925","ISSN":"1941-1197","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"31-43","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Tutorial on Graph-Based SLAM","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"sibleySlidingWindowFilter2006","abstract":"This note describes a Sliding Window Filter that is an on-line constanttime approximation to the feature-based 6-degree-of-freedom full Batch Least Squares Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. We contend that for SLAM to be useful in large environments and over extensive run-times, its computational time complexity must be constant, and its memory requirements should be at most linear. Under this constraint, the “best” algorithm will be the one that comes closest to matching the all-time maximum-likelihood estimate of the full SLAM problem, while also maintaining consistency. We start by formulating SLAM as a Batch Least Squares state estimation problem, and then show how to modify the Batch estimator into an approximate Sliding Window Batch/Recursive framework that achieves constant time complexity and linear space complexity. We argue that viewing SLAM from the Sliding Window Least Squares perspective is very useful for understanding the structure of the problem. This perspective is general, capable of subsuming a number of common estimation techniques such as Bundle Adjustment and Extended Kalman Filter SLAM. By tuning the sliding window, the algorithm can scale from exhaustive Batch solutions to fast incremental solutions; if the window encompasses all time, the solution is algebraically equivalent to full SLAM; if only one time step is maintained, the solution is algebraically equivalent to the Extended Kalman Filter SLAM solution. The Sliding Window Filter enables other interesting properties, like continuous sub-mapping, lazy data association, undelayed or delayed landmark initialization, and incremental robust estimation. We test the algorithm in simulations using stereo vision exterioceptive sensors and inertial measurement proprioceptive sensors. Initial experiments show that the SWF approaches the performance of the optimal batch estimator, even for small windows on the order of 5-10 frames.","author":[{"family":"Sibley","given":"Gabe"}],"citation-key":"sibleySlidingWindowFilter2006","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"A Sliding Window Filter for SLAM","type":"article-journal"},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.
