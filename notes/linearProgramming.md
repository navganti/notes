# Linear Programming

Linear programming is the process of optimizing a linear objective function, subject to linear constraints. The constraints prohibit the optimal result from reaching $\pm\infty$.

The problem statement can be expressed in standard form as: 
$$
\begin{align}
    \min \quad c^Tx,\quad \text{subject to} \; Ax = b, \; x \ge 0
\end{align}
$$
