# Aperture

The aperture of a lens is the diameter of the opening through which light passes. This is typically expressed through a *relative* size, known as the f-number.

This is expressed by
$$
A = f / N
$$
where $A$ is the true area, $f$ is the focal length, and $N$ is the relative aperture or f-number. This is why you will see apertures expressed as $f/2.0$, for example.

*f-stops* are indicators which approximately halve the light at each step. To halve the light, increase $N$ by $\sqrt(2)$.
