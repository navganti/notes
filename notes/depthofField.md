# Depth of Field

Ideally, we would achieve [[perfectFocus|perfect focus]] when taking a picture. This is not usually the case, but the *acceptable range* of focus is given by the depth of field.

The formula for depth of field is given by:
$$
DoF = \frac{2NCU^2}{f^2}
$$

where $N$ is the [[aperture|f-number]], $f$ is the [[focalLength|focal length]], $c$ is the [[circleofConfusion||circle of confusion]], and $u$ is the distance to the subject.

If we have too much blur, it means that we have exceeded the circle of confusion.

>The depth of field refers to the acceptable range of positioning in the real world. This corresponds to the *depth of focus* in the sensor space.
