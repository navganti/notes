# Perfect Focus

Perfect focus is a theoretical objective, where each point an object corresponds to 1 pixel on the camera sensor.

Otherwise, we are effectively performing an integral $\int$ over a small area. Integrating all rays over all pixels would lead to a white image.

This is not attainable - rather, we ensure the [[depthofField|depth of field]] is appropriate for the subject.
