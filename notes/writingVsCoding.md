# Writing vs Coding

The writing process as described by [[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017|Ahrens (2017)]] consists of two main stages: a loose, creative, idea generation stage, followed by a more critical and structured proofreading stage.

These two steps of the writing process require very different types of focus. A writer who aims to be critical during their initial writing phase ("first draft final draft") will get nothing on the paper, and there are similarities between this process and coding.

Coding also consists of a creative phase of development and planning, followed by the critical proofreading stages of PR, testing, and refactors. A coder who is critical during the initial writing phase might fall into classic pitfalls such as premature optimization.
