# Lie Group

A Lie group is a smooth, continuous [[mathGroup|group]]. The Lie group $SO(3)$ defines rotations, while $SE(3)$ defines transformations. The Lie group can be approximated locally about its identity element by the [[lieAlgebra|Lie algebra]].

The Lie group can be converted to the Lie algebra via the logarithmic map.
