# Positional Encoding

Positional encoding is a method to define information of sequence that can be used by a network. This can be predefined or learned by the model.

>[!example]
> In [@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023], the authors use a sinusoidal encoding which assigns a token a value from $0$ to $20000\pi$.

>[!question]
> It seems that sinusoidal encodings are common - is that just accepted practice now?
