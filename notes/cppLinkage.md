# Linkage

The [[cppDeclaration|declaration]] of an entity can occur in three different ways:
 
1. External
2. Internal
3. None

External linkage links to a declaration outside the current scope - an example of this would be referring to a variable included from a header.

Internal linkage is referring to a variable defined elsewhere in the current file.

No linkage means that the variable has only been defined for use in the current scope.
