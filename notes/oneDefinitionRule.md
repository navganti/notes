# One Definition Rule

The one [[cppDefinition|definition]] rule states that there can only be one definition of a `variable`, `function`, `class`, `enum`, etc. within a program, while templates and types can only have one definition within a [[cppTranslation|translation]] unit. 

The exception to this is if a function is defined `inline`.
