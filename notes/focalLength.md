# Focal Length

The focal length of a lens is the distance from a lens that parallel rays converge to a point. When focusing on a point "at infinity", the camera sensor will be exactly one focal length away from the center of projection, or two focal lengths from the lens.

A *weaker* lens has a longer focal length, as it takes longer for the light to converge.
