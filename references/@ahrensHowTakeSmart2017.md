# How to Take Smart Notes

- Make *learning* the primary goal. The process of improvement itself is rewarding.
- Experts do not need to plan, they just react to the upcoming situation.
- Need to be able to switch between different types of focus. 
- Flexibility and adaptability will help you maximize the most out of whatever you are absorbing. 
    - It's not always necessary to read or process everything in the same way. In fact, that can be detrimental.
- When coming up with ideas, there is no need to "brainstorm" - that process will already have been taken care of by writing in the Zettelkasten. Look for where significant connections and ideas have started to appear.
- When writing literature or evergreen notes, ensure that you write them using full sentences. 
    - These notes, when arranged together, will effectively be the first draft of your work.
- In order to truly understand something, you need to write it into your own words. 
- In order to understand something for the long run, you need to write it down.
    - Always ensure you have a pen/paper available to write notes down when reading anything.
- Evergreen notes should be atomic. Each note should ideally discuss one topic only.
- A "First Draft Final Draft" approach will result in nothing getting done. The writing (or coding) process can be broken up into two contrasting approaches
    - The creation stage is free/generative
    - The refinement stage is structured/critical
- Attempting to follow the same process for reading a text is not nearly as effective as being *flexible*. Flexibility and adaptation is the sign of an expert.
- Work on what you want to work on. Rather than forcing yourself to work on something you don't want to do, you need to find a way to feel like doing what moves the project along.
- The brain cannot distinguish between a completed task, and a *postponed* task (writing down a note). This is why cognitive offloading is such an effective strategy.
- Writing information into our own words is the process of retrieval; it tests how truly we understand material.
    - Actually retrieving the material is the true test of whether or not we understand something.
    - Our brain tricks us into believing we know and understand something when reading something.
    - This is especially true if we re-read material. "Seeing something we have seen before causes the same emotional reaction as if we had been able to retrieve the information from our memory."
- Abstracting an idea away from a problem will result in the generation of more pragmatic and generalized solutions.
    - This is especially true for engineers. By abstracting a problem away from its context, we might sometimes stumble upon similar problems in seemingly unrelated fields, allowing us to create more clever solutions.
- Write your literature notes for yourself, but assume your evergreen notes are to be understood by others as well. Being able to explain something (in a lecture, or a note on a small scale) is the true measure of how well you understand something.
